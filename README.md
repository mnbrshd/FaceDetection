# Face Detection Project

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect faces in a video stream.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10.12
* OpenCV 4.5.5+
* MediaPipe 0.8.9.1+

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.10.12.
2. Install OpenCV 4.5.5+.
3. Install MediaPipe 0.8.9.1+.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `main.py` file in a Python IDE.
3. Set the `cap` variable to the device ID of your webcam or the path of your video.
4. Run the code.

## Features

* Detects faces in a video stream.
* It is used in a wide variety of applications, including:

  - Security and surveillance: Face detection can be used to track people's movements in real time, identify people of interest, and prevent crime. For example, it is used in airport security to identify known terrorists, and in retail stores to prevent shoplifting.
  - Biometrics: Face detection can be used to verify a person's identity by comparing their face to a stored image or database. This is used in applications such as passport control, ATMs, and mobile phones.
  - Social media: Face detection is used by social media platforms to tag people in photos and videos, and to suggest friends who may be in the same photo.
  - Entertainment: Face detection is used in virtual reality and augmented reality applications to track the user's face and expressions. This can be used to create more immersive and interactive experiences.
  - Medical: Face detection can be used to monitor patients' health and well-being. For example, it can be used to track a patient's eye movements or facial expressions to detect signs of illness or fatigue.
  - Self-driving cars: Face detection can be used by self-driving cars to identify pedestrians and other vehicles on the road. This information can be used to help the car navigate safely and avoid accidents.
